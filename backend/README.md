# Pizza Delivery Backend

## Error Troubleshooting

### Missing Module: bcryptjs

If you encounter the following error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'bcryptjs'
```

This indicates that the required Node.js package `bcryptjs` is missing. This package is used for password hashing in the User model.

### Solution

Install the missing dependency by running:

```bash
cd D:\pizza\second\backend
npm install bcryptjs
```

Or if you want to install all missing dependencies that might be required:

```bash
cd D:\pizza\second\backend
npm install
```

## Other potential missing dependencies

If you encounter similar errors for other modules, you may need to install them as well. Common dependencies for this project might include:
- express
- mongoose
- jsonwebtoken
- dotenv

You can install them all at once:

```bash
npm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken dotenv bcryptjs
```
